<p> When in doubt, go Goa!  One cannot really go wrong with India’s party capital. A place where people can be seen sunbathing, swimming, parasailing or relaxing in their hammocks sipping a cold beer all year round, Goa is my first pick. In fact, Goa is the best place to kick-start your beach blast in advance with Sunburn Goa this December! Sunburn is when a conglomerate of party mongers and DJs from all over the world get together at the Candolim beach for the grandest New Year beach party. Late night parties, hypnotic music and people dancing away; Sunburn exponentially increases the fun quotient.</p>
<p> Goa stands 6th in the Top 10 Nightlife cities in the world in National Geographic Travel.[74] Notable nightclubs in Goa include Chronicle, Mambos and Sinq.
One of the biggest tourist attractions in Goa is water sports. Beaches like Baga and Calangute offer jet-skiing, parasailing, banana boat rides, water scooter rides, and more. Patnem beach in Palolem stood third in CNN Travel's Top 20 Beaches in Asia. </p>
